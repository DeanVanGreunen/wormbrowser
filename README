This is a C. elegans WebGL body browser coded as part of the OpenWorm project [http://www.openworm.org/]. 

The C. elegans model is provided by the VirtualWorm project [http://caltech.wormbase.org/virtualworm/].

We are using the open-3d-viewer as the WebGl engine, open sourced engine of the ex-Google Body Browser [http://code.google.com/p/open-3d-viewer/].
